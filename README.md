# COVID19-CDC-allocation-evaluation

This repository contains the source code for a detailed compartmental COVID-19 transmission model used in the study [Evaluation of the United States COVID-19 vaccine allocation strategy
](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/comments?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0259700).

The model is fitted to the cumulative deaths and cases in the United States from the beginning of the vaccine roll-out (Dec 14, 2020). Subsequently, a global analysis of all 17.5 million possibly optimal four-phase vaccine allocation strategies are evaluated to find the best one with respect to a certain outcome metric such as minimizing deaths, cases, etc.
